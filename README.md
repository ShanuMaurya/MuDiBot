## Background
MuDiBot was created when there was not a lot of good Discord bots available. It started as a little bot to discover the Discord API and Node.js and began to grow with time. Special thanks to [mozico555](https://github.com/mozico555) for suggestions and ideas.

## Install
**This bot require Node.js 8.0.0 or newer. You can get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/**

Start by running this command in your local bot directory
```
npm install
```

Then, fill `config.js`. More information will be found inside.

**You will also need to create a bot user and invite it to your guild! A guide is on the way.**

## Usage
Start the bot by running `run.sh`

You can then write `$help` (by default) to display all the available commands.
